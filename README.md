Bookshelf

Allows users to input information and keep a log about the books they have read.
They can input information such as the book title, author, genre, and can also write any notes/reviews, as well as give it a numerical rating.
This application uses Flask for the backend, React for the frontend with Chakra UI, and SQLite for the database.
